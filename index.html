      The Joker was a psychotic anarchist mastermind who, portraying himself as an agent of chaos, rose to power in the criminal underworld by thrusting Gotham City into turmoil and drawing Batman ever closer to crossing the fine line between heroism and vigilantism. Described as a "psychopathic, mass murdering, schizophrenic clown with zero empathy", he is potent in both mental combat and strategic planning, and his physique was defined by his clown makeup and gruesome Glasgow smile to add sick comedy to all his crimes and misdeeds.

He was portrayed by the late Heath Ledger as the main antagonist of The Dark Knight, a role that won him a posthumous Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. In addition, largely due to this incarnation's popularity regarding his very dark nature, several later incarnations of the Joker were depicted in a similarly dark manner.
